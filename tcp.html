      <h1>TCP: The Internet’s Careful Courier 📬</h1>
      <p>
        Wanna know why your emails or Netflix shows always show up just right?
        Meet <strong>TCP</strong>, the Transmission Control Protocol, the
        internet’s careful courier! It’s like a delivery worker who makes sure
        every package arrives safe, in order, and perfect. We’ll check out how
        TCP gets the job done, sets up connections, fixes mistakes, keeps
        traffic smooth, chats both ways, and starts with a neat 3-step
        handshake. Ready to see TCP in action? Let’s go! 🚚
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How TCP Works -->
    <section id="how-tcp-works">
      <h2>How TCP Works: The Delivery Plan 📋</h2>
      <p>
        TCP is like a super-careful delivery worker who plans every trip. It’s
        part of the internet’s <span class="highlight">transport layer</span>,
        moving stuff like emails or videos between apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you send an email, TCP chops your message into tiny
        <span class="highlight">pieces</span>, numbers them, and sends them over
        the web. At the other end, TCP gathers the pieces, checks for mistakes,
        and puts them in order. If something’s missing, it asks for it again.
        Like when you watch a movie on Netflix, TCP makes sure every scene plays
        smoothly, no skips!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        TCP’s the plan that gets your stuff delivered right!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Connection-Oriented -->
    <section id="connection-oriented">
      <h2>Connection-Oriented: The Friendly Chat 📞</h2>
      <p>
        TCP loves to <strong>connect first</strong> before sending stuff, like
        calling a buddy to make sure they’re home before dropping off a gift.
        This makes it really trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before sending data, TCP sets up a link with a 3-step handshake (we’ll
        talk about it soon!). This link stays open, like a phone call, so TCP
        can track pieces, fix mistakes, and make sure everything gets there. For
        example, when you sign into a website, TCP’s link keeps your session
        steady. It’s way different from UDP, which just tosses stuff out!
      </p>
      <p class="example">TCP’s friendly chat makes sure nothing gets lost!</p>

    <!-- Error Control -->
    <section id="error-control">
      <h2>Error Control: The Mistake Fixer 🛠️</h2>
      <p>
        TCP is like a worker who checks every package for oopsies. Its
        <strong>error control</strong> makes sure your stuff arrives exactly as
        you sent it, no mess-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        TCP uses a <span class="highlight">checker number</span> to spot
        mistakes in pieces, like seeing if a package is torn. If something’s
        wrong, TCP tosses it and asks for a new one. It also uses
        <span class="highlight">order numbers</span> to keep pieces in line, so
        if one’s missing, TCP grabs it again. Like when you email a photo, TCP
        makes sure it looks perfect!
      </p>
      <p class="example">TCP’s mistake fixer keeps your stuff clean!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Congestion Control -->
    <section id="congestion-control">
      <h2>Congestion Control: The Traffic Helper 🚦</h2>
      <p>
        The internet can get busy, like a crowded street, but TCP’s
        <strong>traffic control</strong> keeps things moving. It’s like a helper
        who stops pile-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        TCP watches for busy signals, like slow replies or lost pieces. If the
        web’s packed, TCP slows down sending to ease the crowd. When it’s clear,
        it speeds up. For example, when you stream a show, TCP tweaks things so
        you don’t get stuck buffering. It uses clever tricks like Reno or Cubic
        to stay smooth, helping everyone on the web!
      </p>

    <!-- Full Duplex -->
    <section id="full-duplex">
      <h2>Full Duplex: Two-Way Talk 🗣️</h2>
      <p>
        TCP is <strong>full duplex</strong>, so it can send and get stuff at the
        same time, like a phone where both people talk without waiting. It’s
        super quick!
      </p>
      <p>
        With full duplex, your device can send data (like typing a chat) and get
        data (like seeing a reply) all at once. For example, in a Zoom call, TCP
        sends your voice and gets your friend’s video together, so the talk
        feels lively. It’s like a road with two lanes, one for each direction!
      </p>
      <p class="example">TCP’s two-way talk keeps chats super smooth!</p>

    <!-- 3-Way Handshake -->
    <section id="3-way-handshake">
      <h2>3-Way Handshake: The Friendly Hello 👋</h2>
      <p>
        Before TCP sends stuff, it does a <strong>3-way handshake</strong>, like
        a quick hello to make sure both sides are ready. It’s a three-step chat
        that sets up a solid link!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the deal: 1. <strong>SYN (Start)</strong>: Your device (like your
        phone) sends a “SYN” piece, like saying, “Yo, can we talk?” It adds a
        random <span class="highlight">start number</span> (say, X) to track
        stuff. 2. <strong>SYN-ACK (Start-Okay)</strong>: The server replies with
        a “SYN-ACK” piece, saying, “Yup, I’m here!” It sends its own start
        number (say, Y) and says, “Got your X!” with X+1. 3.
        <strong>ACK (Okay)</strong>: Your phone sends an “ACK” back, saying,
        “Sweet, we’re good!” It says, “Got your Y!” with Y+1, and the link’s
        ready. For example, when you go to “amazon.com,” this handshake happens
        super fast to connect your browser to the server, so every click works
        perfectly. It’s like a quick “You there? Cool, me too!” before sending
        stuff!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        TCP’s 3-way handshake is the friendly start to data chats!
