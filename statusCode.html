      <h2>HTTP Status Codes: The Web’s Report Cards 📝</h2>
      <p>
        Ever click a link and get a weird “404” message? Or wonder why a website
        loads perfectly? It’s like getting a report card from the internet!
        <strong>HTTP status codes</strong> are little notes the web sends back
        to tell you how things went when you asked for a page or sent data. From
        “Yay, it worked!” to “Oops, something’s wrong,” they keep the web’s
        communication clear. Let’s dive into why these codes exist, check out
        stars like 200 and 404, and explore the different code families. Ready
        to decode the web’s grades? Let’s roll! 🎉

    <!-- Why Status Codes Exist -->
    <section id="why-status-codes">
      <h2>Why Status Codes Exist: The Web’s Feedback 🗣️</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine ordering a smoothie at a café, and the barista says, “Got it!”
        or “Sorry, we’re out of bananas.” HTTP status codes are like that
        feedback, telling your browser (or app) what happened when it asked a
        server for something, like a webpage or a post.
      </p>
      <p>
        These codes are part of HTTP, the web’s order taker. When you visit a
        site, your browser sends a <span class="highlight">request</span>, and
        the server replies with a <span class="highlight">response</span> that
        includes a status code—a three-digit number. It’s like a quick note
        saying, “All good!” (200), “Page missing!” (404), or “Server’s down!”
        (500). They help your browser know what to show you next, making the web
        smooth and clear. Without them, it’d be like ordering a smoothie and
        getting no reply—total confusion!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Status codes are the web’s way of saying, “Here’s how it went!”
      </p>

    <!-- Key Status Codes -->
    <section id="key-status-codes">
      <h2>Star Codes: 200 and 404 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        Some status codes are super famous, like the cool kids of the web. Let’s
        meet two big stars—200 and 404—that you’ve probably seen (or not seen)
        in action!
      </p>

      <!-- 200 -->
      <section id="code-200">
        <h3>200 OK: The Gold Star 🥇</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>200 OK</strong> is the web’s gold star, saying, “Everything’s
          perfect!” It means the server got your request and sent back exactly
          what you asked for, like a webpage or a video, with no hiccups.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when you load “netflix.com” and see the homepage, the
          server’s sending a 200 code. It’s the most common code, quietly
          working behind every successful click. Whether you’re streaming a show
          or checking a tweet, 200’s like a teacher saying, “Great job, here’s
          your page!”
        </p>
        <p class="example">200’s the A+ for a web job well done!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 404 -->
      <section id="code-404">
        <h3>404 Not Found: The Missing Homework 📂</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>404 Not Found</strong> is the web’s “Oops, it’s gone!” note.
          It means the server couldn’t find the page or thing you asked for,
          like looking for a book in the library that’s not on the shelf.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you click a broken link or type “youtube.com/oops,”
          you might see a 404 page saying, “Page not found.” It’s super famous
          (think memes!) and tells your browser the server looked but came up
          empty. It’s like getting a “Try again!” on your homework.
        </p>
        <p class="example">404’s the “Where’d it go?” for missing web stuff!</p>

    <!-- Status Code Ranges -->
    <section id="status-code-ranges">
      <h2>Code Families: The Web’s Report Card Grades 📊</h2>
      <p>
        Status codes come in five big families, grouped by their first digit
        (100s to 500s). Each family has a vibe, like different grades on a
        report card, telling you what’s up with your web request. Let’s meet
        them and some other cool codes!
      </p>

      <!-- 100 Range -->
      <section id="100-range">
        <h3>100s: The “Hold On” Notes ⏳</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>100-range</strong> codes are like a teacher saying, “Hang
          on, I’m checking your work!” They tell your browser the server got the
          request and is working on it, but it’s not done yet. These are rare
          and mostly for behind-the-scenes stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          A star here is <strong>100 Continue</strong>, which says, “Keep
          sending your data, I’m ready!” For example, if you’re uploading a huge
          file, the server might send a 100 to say, “All good, keep going!” You
          don’t see these often, but they’re like a quick wink to keep things
          moving.
        </p>
        <p class="example">100s are the “One sec, I’m on it!” for web chats!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 200 Range -->
      <section id="200-range">
        <h3>200s: The “Nailed It” Grades 🎉</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>200-range</strong> codes are the web’s high-fives, saying,
          “Request successful!” They mean the server did what you asked, like
          fetching a page or saving your data, and everything’s awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides <strong>200 OK</strong>, there’s <strong>201 Created</strong>,
          which pops up when you add something new, like posting a photo (e.g.,
          on Instagram). Another is <strong>204 No Content</strong>, when the
          server’s like, “Done, but nothing to show!” (e.g., deleting a post).
          These are the happy codes you want!
        </p>
        <p class="example">200s are the “You rock!” for web wins!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 300 Range -->
      <section id="300-range">
        <h3>300s: The “Go Over There” Directions 🗺️</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>300-range</strong> codes are like a teacher pointing you
          to another desk. They tell your browser the thing you want is
          somewhere else, often redirecting you to a new page.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common one is <strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>, which says,
          “This page moved for good!” (e.g., a website changes its address).
          Another is <strong>302 Found</strong>, a temporary redirect, like
          “Check this other page for now!” For example, if a shop’s site moves
          to a new URL, a 301 sends you there automatically.
        </p>
        <p class="example">300s are the “Head this way!” for web detours!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 400 Range -->
      <section id="400-range">
        <h3>400s: The “You Messed Up” Warnings ⚠️</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>400-range</strong> codes are like getting a note saying,
          “Oops, you did something wrong!” They mean the problem’s on your
          end—like a bad request or wrong address—and the server can’t help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides <strong>404 Not Found</strong>, there’s
          <strong>400 Bad Request</strong>, when your request is messy (e.g., a
          broken form). Another is <strong>403 Forbidden</strong>, like being
          told, “No entry!” (e.g., trying to access a private page). For
          example, if you type a weird URL, you might get a 400 saying, “That’s
          not right!”
        </p>
        <p class="example">400s are the “Try again!” for your web oopsies!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 500 Range -->
      <section id="500-range">
        <h3>500s: The “Server’s Sick” Alerts 🚨</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>500-range</strong> codes are like a teacher saying,
          “Uh-oh, the school’s printer broke!” They mean something went wrong on
          the server’s side, so it can’t do what you asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big one is <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>, the server’s
          “I’m confused!” note (e.g., a website crashes). Another is
          <strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong>, when the server’s too busy
          or down, like “Come back later!” For example, if a site’s overloaded
          during a sale, you might see a 503.
        </p>
        <p class="example">500s are the “Server’s having a bad day!” alerts!</p>

      <h2>Status Codes Keep the Web Talking! 🗨️</h2>

        And that’s the deal with <strong>HTTP status codes</strong>—the web’s
        report cards that tell you how your clicks and posts are doing! From
        200’s gold stars to 404’s missing pages, and the 100s to 500s families,
        they keep the web’s conversations clear and fun. Next time you surf a
