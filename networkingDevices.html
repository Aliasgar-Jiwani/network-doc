      <h2>Networking Devices: The Internet’s Cool Crew 😎</h2>
      <p>
        Yo, ever wonder how your memes, games, or video calls zip around the
        internet? It’s like a squad of awesome buddies passing a soccer ball
        down the field! These buddies are <strong>networking devices</strong>,
        the gadgets that keep your Wi-Fi humming and your chats flowing. From
        repeaters to routers, they’re the behind-the-scenes champs making your
        online vibes pop. Let’s meet this rad team and see what they do. Ready
        for a quick tour? Let’s kick it! ⚽

    <!-- Repeater -->
    <section id="repeater">
      <h2>Repeater: The Signal Booster 🔊</h2>
      <p>
        Picture your Wi-Fi signal as a song playing softly—you can barely hear
        it in the next room. A <strong>repeater</strong> is like a speaker
        cranking up the tune so it reaches farther! It grabs a weak signal and
        makes it stronger, sending it out to keep your phone or laptop
        connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeaters are super simple—they just amplify the signal without messing
        with the data. Got a big house where Wi-Fi fades in the backyard? Pop a
        repeater in, and bam—your signal’s rocking all the way to the swing set.
        It’s like giving your Wi-Fi a megaphone!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Repeaters pump up the signal to keep the party going!

    <!-- Hub -->
    <section id="hub">
      <h2>Hub: The Chatty Connector 🎤</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a friend who loves to share everyone’s news with the whole
        group. A <strong>hub</strong> is like that—it hooks up devices like
        computers or printers and shouts data to all of them. If your laptop
        sends a file, the hub’s like, “Yo, everyone, check this out!” and the
        right device grabs it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hubs are old-school and a bit loud—they send data to every device, even
        ones that don’t need it, which can slow things down. They’re great for
        tiny networks, like a small office with a few computers. Think of a hub
        as a group text that goes to everyone, whether they care or not.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of Hubs</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>i) Active Hub</strong>: This hub’s got energy! It boosts the
        signal before passing it on, like a friend who repeats your joke louder
        so everyone hears. It needs a power plug to do its thing, keeping
        connections strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ii) Passive Hub</strong>: The laid-back type, this hub just
        connects devices without boosting anything. It’s like a friend who
        passes notes without adding flair—no power needed, but it’s only good
        for short distances.
      </p>
      <p class="example">Hubs keep the chat flowing, active or chill!</p>

    <!-- Bridge -->
    <section id="bridge">
      <h2>Bridge: The Smart Organizer 📋</h2>
      <p>
        Think of a school hallway packed with kids passing notes. A
        <strong>bridge</strong> is like a hall monitor who makes sure notes go
        only to the right kid, not the whole crowd. It connects two parts of a
        network (like two classrooms) and sends data to the correct side by
        checking device IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bridges are smarter than hubs—they learn where devices are and keep
        things tidy, so your network doesn’t get clogged. For example, if your
        game console’s in one room and your PC’s in another, a bridge makes sure
        game data goes straight to the console, not your smart TV. It’s like a
        pro at keeping the hallway calm!
      </p>
      <h3>Types of Bridges</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>i) Transparent Bridge</strong>: This bridge is sneaky—it works
        quietly, figuring out where devices are without anyone noticing. It’s
        like a ninja organizer keeping data flowing smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ii) Source Routing Bridge</strong>: The picky type! It follows
        exact paths chosen by the data’s sender, like a kid who only takes the
        note if it’s got specific directions. It’s old-school and needs extra
        planning but super precise.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Bridges sort the chaos, sending data right where it belongs!
      </p>

    <!-- Switch -->
    <section id="switch">
      <h2>Switch: The Pro Delivery Kid 🚴</h2>
      <p>
        If a hub’s shouting to everyone, a <strong>switch</strong> is like a
        delivery kid who knows exactly which house gets the package. It connects
        devices and sends data <strong>only to the right one</strong>, using
        device IDs to nail the drop-off. This keeps your network fast and quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Switches are the stars of most networks—like the ones in your Wi-Fi
        router. When you’re streaming a show, a switch makes sure the video goes
        to your tablet, not your smart lightbulb. They can handle lots of
        deliveries at once, so everyone’s happy. Way cooler than a hub!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Switches zoom data to the right spot like pros!</p>

    <!-- Router -->
    <section id="router">
      <h2>Router: The Map Master 🗺️</h2>
      <p>
        Picture a guide who knows the best way to get anywhere in the world. A
        <strong>router</strong> is like that for data—it finds the fastest path
        to send your stuff across networks, like from your house to a website in
        London. It uses addresses (like 192.168.0.1) to pick the right route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Routers are the internet’s VIPs. Your home Wi-Fi router links your
        devices to the web, deciding if your Instagram post stays local or
        travels far. They’re smart, dodging traffic jams and even blocking shady
        stuff. Without routers, the internet would be a bunch of lonely
        neighborhoods!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Routers map the way, connecting the whole internet!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Gateway -->
    <section id="gateway">
      <h2>Gateway: The Friendly Translator 🗣️</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a buddy who speaks every language and helps friends from
        different places chat. A <strong>gateway</strong> does that for
        networks—it connects ones that use different rules (like your home Wi-Fi
        to the internet) and translates data so they get each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gateways are like routers with extra skills. Your home router might
        double as a gateway, linking your network to your internet provider’s
        setup. They make sure your game downloads or video calls work, no matter
        what kind of network is out there. It’s like a universal handshake!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Gateways make all networks besties, no matter the rules!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Brouter -->
    <section id="brouter">
      <h2>Brouter: The Double-Duty Pal 🤹</h2>
      <p>
        Meet the <strong>brouter</strong>, a gadget that’s half bridge, half
        router—like a kid who’s great at soccer and basketball! It can connect
        nearby networks like a bridge (using device IDs) or guide data across
        far networks like a router (using internet addresses).
      </p>
      <p>
        Brouters aren’t super common now—switches and routers usually take the
        stage—but they were awesome for networks needing both jobs. Imagine a
        brouter linking two school labs (bridge style) while also sending data
        to the web (router style). It’s a jack-of-all-trades, though modern gear
        often splits the work.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Brouters juggle two gigs like a networking rockstar!

      <p>
        And that’s the <strong>networking devices</strong> crew—each one’s got a
        killer move to keep your internet rolling! From repeaters boosting
        signals to gateways making networks chat, they’re like a tight squad
        passing the ball to score. Next time you’re gaming, streaming, or
