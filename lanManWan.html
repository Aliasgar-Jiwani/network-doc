      <h2>LAN, MAN, WAN: Let’s Make Sense of Networks 🌐</h2>
      <p>
        Ever wondered how your phone talks to your TV or how you can video call
        a friend on the other side of the world? 🤔 It’s all thanks to networks:
        <strong>LAN</strong>, <strong>MAN</strong>, and <strong>WAN</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break them down with some fun, real-life examples. 🚀</p>
    </section>

    <!-- LAN -->
    <section id="lan">
      <h2>LAN: Your Room’s Private Party 🏠</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>LAN (Local Area Network)</strong> is like having a
        <strong>private party</strong>
        with your friends at home. 🛋️ Only the people inside your house can join
        in. You can share photos, stream movies, or play games—just with the
        folks in your space.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tech terms, LANs connect devices in a <strong>small area</strong>,
        like your home, school, or office. When you send a print job from your
        laptop to the printer nearby, you’re using a LAN.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MAN -->
    <section id="man">
      <h2>MAN: Your City’s Group Chat 🌆</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</strong> is like a
        <strong>giant group chat</strong>
        for your whole city. 🏙️ Schools, offices, and public services can share
        info and resources with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when you connect to <strong>free Wi-Fi</strong> at a park
        or library, you’re using a MAN. It links different parts of a city
        together.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WAN -->
    <section id="wan">
      <h2>WAN: The Internet’s Global Party 🌍</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>WAN (Wide Area Network)</strong> is like the
        <strong>biggest party</strong> in the world. 🌎 It connects cities,
        countries, and continents—making it possible for you to video call a
        friend in another country or play games on international servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Internet</strong> itself is the most famous WAN—it’s what
        connects people around the globe.
      </p>

      <h2>How Are Today’s Networks Related to LAN, MAN, and WAN?</h2>
      <p>
        Ever thought about how your <strong>Netflix binge</strong> or your
        <strong>Zoom calls</strong> actually work? 🤔 It’s all thanks to the
        <strong>combination</strong> of LAN, MAN, and WAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picture this: You’re at home (LAN) streaming a show. The data travels
        through your city’s service provider (MAN) before reaching a
        <strong>distant data center</strong> (WAN), which holds the content. So
        yes, today’s networks are a collection of these three working together
        like a <strong>tag team</strong>. 💥
      </p>

    <section id="sonet">
      <h2>🔗 What is SONET in LAN, MAN, WAN?</h2>
      <p>
        Alright, imagine you’re
        <strong>sending a super-speedy postcard</strong>. ✉️ SONET (<strong
          >Synchronous Optical Network</strong
        >) is a <strong>high-speed data delivery system</strong> used in MAN and
        WAN networks. It uses <strong>fiber optic cables</strong> to transfer
        data over <strong>long distances</strong> at lightning speed. 🚀
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s like the <strong>express delivery</strong> service of networking,
        ensuring that data reaches different cities or countries super fast.
      </p>

    <section id="frame-relay">
      <h2>⚙️ What is Frame Relay in LAN, MAN, WAN?</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine <strong>passing notes</strong> in class, but with a shortcut. 📝
        Frame relay is a <strong>data transfer method</strong> used in WANs that
        sends data in <strong>small, speedy packets</strong> instead of large
        chunks.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s great for transferring info between different cities or regions
        because it’s <strong>faster and more efficient</strong>. Think of it
        like
        <strong>splitting a big delivery into smaller, faster batches</strong>.
        🚚💨
