    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Welcome to the World of Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you’re at a huge party with tons of friends. Everyone’s chatting
        and laughing, but there are some rules to keep things smooth—like
        talking one at a time or waving to get attention. These rules are like
        <strong>protocols</strong> on the internet. They help computers and
        phones talk to each other so we can send messages, watch videos, and
        have fun online without any mess-ups!

    <!-- TCP Section -->
    <section id="tcp">
      <h2>TCP: The Careful Postman 📬</h2>
      <p>
        Meet <strong>TCP</strong>—the internet’s super careful postman! When you
        send something important, like a letter to your best friend, TCP makes
        sure it gets there perfectly. Picture sending a big story one page at a
        time. TCP checks that every page arrives in the right order, and if one
        gets lost, it sends it again. It’s awesome for stuff like emails or
        downloading games, where you want everything just right.

    <!-- UDP Section -->
    <section id="udp">
      <h2>UDP: The Speedy Messenger 🏃‍♂️</h2>
      <p>
        Then there’s <strong>UDP</strong>—the fast runner of the internet! UDP
        is all about speed, not perfection. It’s like shouting a quick “Hi!”
        across a busy playground—it might get heard, or it might not, but it’s
        super fast. That’s why we use UDP for things like live video chats or
        online games, where waiting is a bummer, and a tiny glitch doesn’t ruin
        the fun.

    <!-- HTTP Section -->
    <section id="http">
      <h2>HTTP: The Friendly Waiter 🍽️</h2>
      <p>
        Say hello to <strong>HTTP</strong>—the waiter who makes the web work!
        When you want to see a cool website, your browser (that’s you!) tells
        HTTP what you’d like, like ordering a yummy pizza. HTTP runs to the
        kitchen (the server), grabs your pizza (the webpage), and brings it back
        to you. It’s how you get to surf the internet and see all the awesome
        stuff online!

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Protocols Make the Internet Awesome</h2>
      <p>
        The internet might seem like magic, but it’s really these cool protocols
        teaming up. TCP keeps things perfect, UDP makes them fast, and HTTP
        delivers the fun right to your screen. Next time you’re gaming,
        chatting, or browsing, think about these hidden heroes making it all
        happen!
