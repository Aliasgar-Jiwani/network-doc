    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Submarine Cables: The Internet’s Secret Tunnels 🌊</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know the internet travels under the ocean? Giant cables, like
        underwater highways, connect the world and make the internet super fast.
        Let’s explore how it all works, from speedy connections to invisible
        signals!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- a) Internet Speed -->
    <section id="internet-speed">
      <h2>Internet Speed: How Fast is Fast? 🚀</h2>
      <p>
        Internet speed is measured in <strong>bits</strong>—tiny pieces of data.
        Think of bits like candies in a jar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Kilobits (Kbps)</strong>: A small handful of candies—pretty
          slow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Megabits (Mbps)</strong>: A big bag of candies—good for videos
          and games!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gigabits (Gbps)</strong>: A whole candy store—super fast for
          everything!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Download speed</strong> is how fast you can grab stuff (like
        watching a movie), and <strong>upload speed</strong> is how fast you can
        send stuff (like posting a picture). More candies mean quicker internet!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Guided and Unguided Connections -->
    <section id="guided-unguided">
      <h2>Guided vs. Unguided Connections: Slides and Shouts 🎢</h2>
      <p>There are two ways data moves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Guided</strong>: Like a slide at the playground—data zooms
          through cables (like wires or submarine cables).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unguided</strong>: Like shouting to a friend—data flies
          through the air (wireless signals).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Slides (guided) are faster and safer, but shouting (unguided) is easier
        when there’s no slide around!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- c) Submarine Cable Map -->
    <section id="cable-map">
      <h2>Submarine Cable Map: The Treasure Map 🗺️</h2>
      <p>
        Want to see where these underwater cables are? Check out this cool map:
        <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank"
          >Submarine Cable Map</a
        >. It’s like a treasure map showing secret tunnels under the sea!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- d) Explaining the Map -->
    <section id="map-explanation">
      <h2>What Does the Map Show? 🌍</h2>
      <p>
        The map shows cables under the ocean connecting countries, like a big
        web. These lines carry your games, videos, and chats from one place to
        another. Without them, the internet would be slow—like waiting for a
        letter in the mail!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- e) How Submarine Cables Work -->
    <section id="how-cables-work">
      <h2>How Do Submarine Cables Work? 🌊</h2>
      <p>
        Submarine cables are like super-fast tunnels for light. Here’s how it
        works:
      </p>
      <pre>
      🌍 ---[Cable]--- 🌍
      (Land)   (Ocean)  (Land)
      </pre>
      <p>
        Your data turns into light, zooms through the cable under the sea, and
        pops out on the other side. It’s like sending a super-speedy message in
        a bottle!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- f) Physical Connections -->
    <section id="physical-connections">
      <h2>Physical Connections: The Strong Stuff 💪</h2>
      <p>Here are two types of cables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Optical Fibre</strong>: A tiny tunnel that uses light to send
          data super fast—perfect for submarine cables!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coaxial Cable</strong>: A tough pipe that uses electricity to
          carry data—good for shorter trips, like in your house.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- g) Wireless Connections -->
    <section id="wireless-connections">
      <h2>Wireless Connections: Invisible Magic ✨</h2>
      <p>Wireless is like magic threads connecting things without cables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bluetooth</strong>: A short thread for headphones or speakers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>WiFi</strong>: A bigger thread for internet at home.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>3G, 4G, LTE, 5G</strong>: Super threads for internet on your
          phone, anywhere!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- h) Why Not Satellites? -->
    <section id="why-not-satellites">
      <h2>Why Don’t We Use Satellites? 🛰️</h2>
      <p>
        Satellites are awesome—like sending messages with space balloons—but
        here’s why we love submarine cables more:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed</strong>: Cables are faster because data doesn’t have to
          fly to space and back.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Cables are cheaper once they’re built.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability</strong>: Cables don’t mind storms or space junk!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Satellites are great for some stuff (like maps on your phone), but
        cables are the internet’s real superheroes!
      </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>The End of Our Adventure 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        From secret underwater cables to invisible wireless magic, the internet
        is amazing! Next time you’re online, think about those speedy tunnels
        under the sea—they’re the hidden heroes keeping us connected!
