      <h1>IP: The Internet’s Address Book 📒</h1>
      <p>
        Ever think about how your phone sends a video to a friend far away?
        That’s the magic of <strong>IP</strong>, the Internet Protocol, the
        web’s address book! It gives every gadget a special address and guides
        data to the right spot. We’ll check out what IP does, its two types
        (IPv4 and IPv6), how addresses are split and given out, and what’s
        inside its data packages. Ready to explore the web’s address system?
        Let’s dive in! 🎉
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What is IP -->
    <section id="what-is-ip">
      <h2>What’s IP? The Web’s Address Helper 🏠</h2>
      <p>
        IP is like a big address book that gives every device—like your laptop
        or a game server—a unique address. It’s part of the
        <span class="highlight">network layer</span> in the internet’s system,
        called TCP/IP.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you send a message, IP puts it in a little
        <span class="highlight">package</span> with two addresses: one for the
        sender (you) and one for the receiver (like a YouTube server). Then, it
        helps the package hop through the web’s roads to get there. For example,
        when you watch a YouTube video, IP makes sure the video clips find your
        phone, no matter where the server is!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        IP’s the helper sending your stuff to the right address!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IPv4 -->
    <section id="ipv4">
      <h2>IPv4: The Old Address Style 📬</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>IPv4</strong> is the classic way to make addresses for the
        internet. It’s been used for ages and gives devices short addresses made
        of four numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        An IPv4 address looks like 192.168.0.1. Each number is between 0 and
        255, and they’re split by dots. It uses 32 bits (like 32 tiny switches),
        which makes about 4 billion addresses. That’s a lot, but with so many
        phones, laptops, and smart TVs, we’re running out! For example, your
        Wi-Fi router might have an IPv4 address like 192.168.1.1 to connect your
        gadgets at home.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        IPv4’s the old-school address keeping the web going!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IPv6 -->
    <section id="ipv6">
      <h2>IPv6: The New Giant Address Style 📮</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>IPv6</strong> is the new, bigger way to make addresses. It was
        created to give the web tons more space for all our gadgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        An IPv6 address looks like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, with
        eight groups of numbers and letters separated by colons. It uses 128
        bits, which means it can make trillions and trillions of
        addresses—enough for every device forever! It’s also faster and safer
        for the web. For example, new smart devices, like a smart light bulb,
        often use IPv6 to connect easily.
      </p>
      <p class="example">IPv6’s the giant address style for the future!</p>

    <!-- Subnetting -->
    <section id="subnetting">
      <h2>Subnetting: Making Mini-Networks 🏘️</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Subnetting</strong> is like splitting a big town into small
        neighborhoods to keep things neat. It breaks a big network into smaller
        chunks called subnets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each subnet has its own group of addresses, so gadgets in one subnet
        (like your home Wi-Fi) don’t get mixed up with others (like a coffee
        shop’s Wi-Fi). This makes the web faster, safer, and easier to manage.
        For example, a school might use subnetting to keep student computers in
        one subnet and teacher computers in another, so data stays organized.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Subnetting’s like making mini-towns for web neatness!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How IP Addresses Are Assigned -->
    <section id="ip-assignment">
      <h2>How Addresses Get Picked: The Address Boss 🎟️</h2>
      <p>
        IP addresses aren’t just random numbers—they’re given out carefully,
        like handing out house numbers in a town. There’s a system to make sure
        every gadget gets the right address.
      </p>
      <p>
        A big group called <span class="highlight">ICANN</span> gives out chunks
        of addresses to internet companies, like AT&T or Comcast. Those
        companies then give addresses to your Wi-Fi router. Your router uses a
        helper called <strong>DHCP</strong> to pick addresses for your phone or
        laptop, like 192.168.0.2. Some gadgets, like servers, get fixed
        addresses that never change (static), while your phone gets a new one
        each time it joins Wi-Fi (dynamic). For example, YouTube’s server keeps
        the same address, but your tablet’s changes at a new café!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Addresses are picked to keep the web tidy and fair!</p>

    <!-- Breaking Down 192.168.2/30 -->
    <section id="ip-breakdown">
      <h2>Breaking Down 192.168.2/30: The Address Puzzle 🧩</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s take an address like 192.168.2 with a /30 subnet and split it into
        parts: the network part, subnet part, and device part (called host ID).
        It’s like reading a house’s street and number!
      </p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Network Part</strong>: The 192.168.2 is like the street name,
        showing the big network this address lives in, like your home Wi-Fi’s
        main group. - <strong>Subnet (/30)</strong>: The /30 means 30 bits are
        used for the network and subnet, leaving 2 bits for devices. Those 2
        bits make 4 addresses total: 1 for the network (like 192.168.2.0), 1 for
        sending to everyone (broadcast, like 192.168.2.3), and 2 for devices
        (like 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.2). It’s a super-tiny subnet! -
        <strong>Device Part (Host ID)</strong>: The last number (like .2 in
        192.168.2.2) picks the exact gadget, like your phone. With /30, only two
        gadgets can have addresses in this subnet. For example, in
        192.168.2.0/30, your router might be 192.168.2.1, and your laptop
        192.168.2.2. It’s like a street with just two houses!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        192.168.2/30’s a tiny puzzle for a couple of gadgets!
      </p>

    <!-- Class of IP Addresses -->
    <section id="ip-classes">
      <h2>IP Address Groups: The Address Types 🏷️</h2>
      <p>
        IPv4 addresses are sorted into five types, called
        <strong>classes A, B, C, D, E</strong>, like different kinds of houses
        in the web’s town. Each type has a special job.
      </p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Class A</strong>: For huge networks (starts with 0-127, like
        10.0.0.1). Used by giant groups, like internet companies, with tons of
        gadgets. - <strong>Class B</strong>: For medium networks (starts with
        128-191, like 172.16.0.1). Good for places like colleges with lots of
        computers. - <strong>Class C</strong>: For small networks (starts with
        192-223, like 192.168.0.1). Perfect for homes or small shops, like your
        Wi-Fi. - <strong>Class D</strong>: For group messages (starts with
        224-239, like 239.0.0.1). Used to send data to many gadgets, like live
        video streams. - <strong>Class E</strong>: For experiments (starts with
        240-255). Not used much, just for testing. For example, your home’s
        192.168.0.1 is a Class C address, great for a small Wi-Fi network!
      </p>
      <p class="example">IP classes are like house types for web addresses!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Subnet Masking -->
    <section id="subnet-masking">
      <h2>Subnet Masking: The Address Divider 🎨</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>subnet mask</strong> is like a divider that splits an IP
        address into two parts: the network part and the gadget part. It helps
        keep the web organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mask looks like 255.255.255.0, where 255 says “this is the network
        part” and 0 says “this is the gadget part.” For example, with the
        address 192.168.1.5 and mask 255.255.255.0, 192.168.1 is the network
        (like the street), and .5 is the gadget (like the house). A mask like
        /30 (255.255.255.252) makes a tiny subnet with just 4 addresses. It’s
        like coloring a picture to show which parts belong together!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Subnet masks divide addresses to keep things neat!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- IP Packets -->
    <section id="ip-packets">
      <h2>IP Packages: The Web’s Little Boxes 📦</h2>
      <p>
        IP sends data in small <strong>packages</strong> called packets, like
        little boxes with labels. Each packet has a
        <span class="highlight">label</span> (called a header) that’s 20 bytes
        long in IPv4 to help it get to the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The label has important bits: - <strong>IP Version</strong>: Says if
        it’s IPv4 or IPv6 (like “this is an IPv4 box”). -
        <strong>Length</strong>: Shows how big the whole package is. -
        <strong>Identification</strong>: A number to keep track of packages if
        they’re split up. - <strong>Flags</strong>: Says if the package can be
        broken into pieces or not. - <strong>Protocol</strong>: Tells what’s
        next, like TCP (for web pages) or UDP (for videos). -
        <strong>Checksum</strong>: A check to make sure the label isn’t messed
        up. - <strong>Addresses</strong>: The sender’s and receiver’s IP
        addresses, like return and delivery addresses. -
        <strong>TTL (Time to Live)</strong>: A number that counts hops (stops)
        to stop lost packages from circling forever. For example, when you
        stream a Netflix show, each video piece travels in a packet with a label
        guiding it to your tablet!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        IP packages are little boxes zipping data around the web!

      <h2>IPv4 vs. IPv6: Old School vs. New School 📬📮</h2>
      <p>
        IPv4 and IPv6 are like the old and new ways to write addresses for the
        internet. They both help gadgets connect, but they’re super different.
