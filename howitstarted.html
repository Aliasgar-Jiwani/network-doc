      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a world where people chat across oceans in a snap, where secrets and stories zip around like magic. That’s what networking does—it ties us all together! It started way back during the Cold War, with a little idea called ARPANET, and grew into the giant internet we love today. From slow letters to fast clicks, networking has changed how we talk, share, and explore, making the world feel like one big, noisy neighborhood.

    <!-- Cold War & ARPANET -->

      <h2>Cold War & ARPANET</h2>
      <p>
        Picture the 1950s: the Cold War had everyone on edge. The United States was scared that a big bomb could cut off all its phone lines. So, in 1958, they started the <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</strong>, a team of smart folks meant to invent cool stuff to keep the country safe and chatting, no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in 1969, something amazing happened. ARPA rolled out <strong>ARPANET</strong>, a super clever network. Instead of one long line that could break, it chopped messages into tiny bits, like puzzle pieces, and sent them racing through different paths. On October 29, the first try was to type “LOGIN,” but it crashed after “LOG.” Oops! Still, that shaky start was the beginning of something huge—the internet’s first baby step.

    <!-- TCP/IP Protocol -->

      <h2>TCP/IP Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        By the 1970s, networks were popping up everywhere, but they didn’t speak the same language. Two brainy guys, <strong>Vinton Cerf</strong> and <strong>Bob Kahn</strong>, had a big idea: the <strong>TCP/IP protocol</strong>. IP was like giving every computer its own address, and TCP made sure the messages got there safe and sound. In 1983, ARPANET switched to this new trick, connecting all the networks into one giant web. It was like teaching the world’s machines to hold hands and chat—a game-changer!

    <!-- World Wide Web -->
    <section id="www">
      <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
      <p>
        In 1989, at a science place called CERN, <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> had a lightbulb moment. He wanted everyone to share info easily, no fuss. So, he whipped up HTML to make web pages, HTTP to send them around, and URLs to point the way. It started small, just for brainy scientists, but soon browsers like Mosaic and Netscape popped up, letting regular folks jump in. The World Wide Web took off like a rocket, turning a tangle of computers into a treasure chest of fun and facts for all.

    <!-- First Website -->

      <h2>First Website</h2>
      <p>
        On August 6, 1991, the first website blinked to life: <a href="http://info.cern.ch" target="_blank">info.cern.ch</a>. It lived on Tim Berners-Lee’s fancy NeXT computer, a plain page with words that showed people how to use the web and build their own spots. It was like a friendly guide for a brand-new world. Years later, in 2013, CERN brought it back to life, letting us peek at the web’s baby pictures—a sweet reminder of where it all kicked off.

    <!-- Protocols & Internet Society -->
    <section id="protocols">
      <h2>Protocols & Internet Society</h2>
      <p>
        Protocols are like secret rules that help computers talk without fighting. They keep things smooth, whether it’s web pages flying with HTTP, emails zipping via SMTP, or secrets staying safe with SSL/TLS. In 1992, the Internet Society (ISOC) showed up, like a big cheerleader for the internet. They work hard to keep it free and open, making sure everyone can join the fun and stay connected, no matter where they are.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🌐 <strong>HTTP</strong> – Zooms web pages right to your screen, quick as a wink.</li>
        <li>📩 <strong>SMTP</strong> – Carries your emails far and wide, like a speedy pigeon.</li>
        <li>🔒 <strong>SSL/TLS</strong> – Locks up your info tight, keeping sneaky eyes away.</li>
      </ul>
