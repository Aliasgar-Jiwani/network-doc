      <h2>Cookies: The Web’s Sticky Notes 📌</h2>
      <p>
        Ever notice how a website remembers your name or keeps your cart full?
        It’s like the web’s leaving little sticky notes just for you!
        <strong>Cookies</strong> are tiny bits of info websites save on your
        device to make browsing smoother and more personal. They’re like notes
        tucked in your backpack, holding details like your login or favorite
        settings. Let’s peel back the layers of cookies, see what they save, how
        they’re stored and shared, and what’s up with third-party cookies. Ready
        to dig into this web treat? Let’s munch! 🎉

      <h2>What Are Cookies? The Web’s Memory Tags 🏷️</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are like tiny sticky notes a website sticks on your device
        (phone, laptop, etc.) when you visit. They hold small bits of info to
        remember you or your actions, making the web feel like it knows you.
        Think of them as a librarian jotting down your favorite books to find
        them faster next time!
      </p>
      <p>
        When you browse a site, the server sends a cookie with your
        <span class="highlight">HTTP request</span>, and your browser saves it.
        Next time you visit, your browser sends the cookie back with the
        <span class="highlight">response</span>, so the site recalls who you
        are. Cookies are super small (just text, like a name or ID) and work
        with HTTP to keep your web trips smooth and cozy!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Cookies are the web’s way of saying, “Hey, I remember you!”

    <!-- What Do Cookies Save? -->

      <h2>What Do Cookies Save? Your Web Favorites 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies save all sorts of handy stuff to make your web life easier.
        They’re like notes reminding a website what you like or what you were
        doing. Here’s a peek at what they might hold!
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, cookies can save your <strong>login info</strong> (like a
        session ID, not your password!) so you stay signed into Netflix without
        logging in every time. They might store your
        <strong>cart items</strong> on an online shop, like remembering your
        T-shirt pick on Amazon. Or they can keep your <strong>settings</strong>,
        like a dark mode choice on YouTube, so the site looks just how you like
        it. They’re like a friend who remembers your usual coffee order!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Cookies jot down your web faves to keep things smooth!

    <!-- How Are Cookies Stored? -->
    <section id="how-cookies-stored">
      <h2>How Are Cookies Stored? Your Browser’s Notebook 📓</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies live in your browser, like notes tucked into a special notebook.
        When a website sends a cookie, your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) saves
        it in a tiny file on your device, usually in a folder just for that
        site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each cookie is a small text string, like “user=Jane; theme=dark,” with a
        name, value, and extras like an expiration date (e.g., a week or a
        year). Your browser keeps them organized by website, so Netflix’s
        cookies don’t mix with Twitter’s. You can even peek at them in your
        browser’s settings (under “Privacy” or “Developer Tools”)! Some cookies
        vanish when you close the browser (session cookies), while others stick
        around (persistent cookies) until they expire or you clear them.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Cookies are stored in your browser’s notebook, neat and tidy!
      </p>

    <!-- How Are Cookies Shared? -->
    <section id="how-cookies-shared">
      <h2>How Are Cookies Shared? Passing Notes 📬</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are like notes passed back and forth between your browser and a
        website. Every time you visit a site, your browser sends its cookies for
        that site along with the HTTP request, like handing over your sticky
        notes to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when you go back to Amazon, your browser sends cookies with
        your cart or login ID, so the server knows it’s you. The server can also
        send new cookies or update old ones in its response, like adding a note
        about your latest search. Cookies are only shared with the site that
        made them (or its domain), so they stay private to that website—unless
        they’re third-party cookies, which we’ll get to next!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Cookies pass notes to keep your web chats personal!</p>

    <!-- What Are Third-Party Cookies? -->
    <section id="third-party-cookies">
      <h2>Third-Party Cookies: The Guest Notes 🕵️</h2>
      <p>
        Most cookies come from the site you’re on, like Amazon’s own sticky
        notes. But <strong>third-party cookies</strong> are like notes from a
        guest—like an ad company or tracker—hanging out on that site. They’re
        placed by a different domain, not the one you’re visiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you’re on a blog with Google ads, Google might set a
        third-party cookie to track which ads you see across sites. These
        cookies help with stuff like targeted ads (e.g., showing you sneakers
        after browsing a shoe site) but can feel nosy, so browsers like Chrome
        are starting to block them. Unlike regular cookies, third-party ones can
        follow you across different websites, like a guest scribbling notes
        about your web adventures!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Third-party cookies are sneaky guest notes watching your moves!

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Cookies Make the Web Tasty! 🍪</h2>
      <p>
        And that’s the scoop on <strong>cookies</strong>—the web’s sticky notes
        that make browsing feel like home! From saving your login and cart to
        storing settings, getting tucked into your browser’s notebook, passing
        notes with sites, and those sneaky third-party cookies, they’re the
        little helpers behind your web fun. Next time a site remembers you or
        shows a creepy ad, give a wink to cookies—they’re the web’s memory
        champs! 🌈
