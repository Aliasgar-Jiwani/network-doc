    <!-- What Are Middle Boxes -->
    <section id="what-are-middle-boxes">
      <h2>What Are Middle Boxes? The Web’s Helpers 🚪</h2>
      <p>
        Middle boxes are like gatekeepers that stand between your device (like a phone) and the rest of the internet. They’re special boxes that watch, sort, or change the data zooming by.
      </p>
      <p>
        These boxes do cool jobs, like keeping hackers out, speeding up data, or fixing addresses so lots of gadgets can share the web. They’re found in places like your home Wi-Fi router or big company networks. For example, when you stream a video, a middle box might check if it’s safe or make sure it gets to you fast. Think of them as the web’s busy helpers!

    <!-- Firewall -->

      <h2>Firewall: The Web’s Security Guard 🔒</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>firewall</strong> is a type of middle box that acts like a super-strict security guard for the internet. It checks every bit of data going in or out to keep your network safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firewalls block bad stuff, like viruses or hackers, and let good stuff, like your emails, pass through. They’re like a gate that only opens for trusted visitors. For example, when you visit a website, the firewall makes sure the site’s data is okay before it reaches your laptop. Without firewalls, the web would be a wild, unsafe place!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Firewalls are the guards keeping your web world secure!</p>

    <!-- How Firewall Filters and What It Checks -->
    <section id="firewall-filtering">
      <h2>How Firewalls Work: Checking the Guest List 📋</h2>
      <p>
        Firewalls filter data by checking it against a set of rules, like a security guard with a guest list. If the data looks okay, it gets through; if not, it’s stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s what a firewall checks in every data <span class="highlight">package</span>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Addresses</strong>: Looks at the sender’s and receiver’s IP addresses, like checking who’s sending a letter and who’s getting it. For example, it might block a package from a known hacker’s address.</li>
          <li><strong>Ports</strong>: Checks the port number, like a mailbox slot, to see what kind of data it is (e.g., web or email). It might block weird ports hackers use.</li>
          <li><strong>Rules</strong>: Follows a list saying what’s allowed, like “let YouTube in, but block sketchy sites.” It can also check if the data matches safe patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>State</strong>: For fancier firewalls, they track if the data is part of a trusted conversation, like making sure a reply matches a request you sent.</li>
        </ul>
        For example, if you’re downloading a game, the firewall checks the game’s data to make sure it’s not hiding a virus, letting only safe stuff reach your computer!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Firewalls check the guest list to let only safe data in!</p>

    <!-- NAT -->
    <section id="nat">
      <h2>NAT: The Web’s Address Magician 🎩</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>NAT</strong>, or Network Address Translation, is another middle box that’s like a magician swapping addresses to let lots of gadgets share one internet connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAT takes the private addresses of your gadgets (like 192.168.0.2 for your phone) and changes them to a single public address (like 203.0.113.1) that the internet sees. It’s like giving your whole house one mailbox for all your letters. When data comes back, NAT sends it to the right gadget. For example, when you and your family stream videos, NAT makes sure everyone’s data gets to the right TV or phone!
      </p>
      <p class="example">NAT’s the magician making addresses work for everyone!</p>

    <!-- Why We Use NAT -->
    <section id="why-nat">
      <h2>Why Use NAT? Sharing and Hiding 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        NAT is super important because it helps save addresses and keeps your gadgets safe. Let’s see why we love it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Saves Addresses</strong>: IPv4 only has 4 billion addresses, which isn’t enough for every gadget. NAT lets many devices (like your phone, laptop, and smart speaker) share one public address, so we don’t run out. For example, your home router uses NAT to let all your gadgets use one address to surf the web!</li>
          <li><strong>Hides Gadgets</strong>: NAT keeps your private addresses hidden from the internet, like locking your house’s doors. This makes it harder for hackers to find your devices. For instance, a hacker sees your router’s public address but not your tablet’s private one.</li>
          <li><strong>Makes Sharing Easy</strong>: NAT lets multiple gadgets use the same internet connection without fighting. Like when you’re gaming and your sibling’s streaming, NAT keeps everyone’s data sorted.</li>
        </ul>
        For example, at a café, NAT lets dozens of people use the Wi-Fi with just one public address, keeping things smooth and secure!
      </p>
      <p class="example">NAT saves addresses and keeps your gadgets sneaky-safe!</p>
