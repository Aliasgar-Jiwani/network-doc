      <h2>TCP/IP Transport Layer: The Internet’s Delivery Crew 🚚</h2>
      <p>
        Ever wonder how your messages, videos, or game moves zip across the
        internet without getting lost? Meet the
        <strong>TCP/IP transport layer</strong>, the internet’s delivery crew!
        It’s like a team of super-organized couriers making sure your data gets
        to the right app, in the right order, without traffic jams. We’ll check
        out how it differs from the network layer, how it juggles data, keeps
        traffic smooth, and uses cool tools like checksums and timers. Ready to
        ride along with the delivery squad? Let’s hit the road! 🎉

    <!-- Difference Between Network and Transport Layer -->
    <section id="network-vs-transport">
      <h2>Network vs. Transport Layer: The Road vs. the Courier 📍</h2>
      <p>
        The TCP/IP model has layers, like floors in a delivery warehouse, and
        the <strong>network layer</strong> and
        <strong>transport layer</strong> have different jobs. Think of the
        network layer as the road map, and the transport layer as the courier
        who uses it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>network layer</strong> (handled by IP) is about getting data
        from one device to another, like plotting a route from your phone to a
        Netflix server using <span class="highlight">IP addresses</span>. It
        doesn’t care what’s in the package or which app needs it. The
        <strong>transport layer</strong> (handled by TCP or UDP) takes over to
        deliver the data to the right app, like handing a package to the Netflix
        app, not the email app. It adds reliability, order, and traffic control,
        making sure the data arrives perfectly. Together, they’re a dream team!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Network layer maps the route, transport layer delivers the goods!

    <!-- Multiplexing and Demultiplexing -->
    <section id="multiplexing-demultiplexing">
      <h2>Multiplexing & Demultiplexing: The Sorting Hub 📦</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a busy delivery hub where one truck carries packages for tons of
        apps—browser, chat, games. The transport layer uses
        <strong>multiplexing</strong> and <strong>demultiplexing</strong> to
        sort this chaos, like a super-smart mailroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multiplexing</strong> is when your device packs data from
        different apps (like a YouTube video and a Discord message) into one
        stream, using <span class="highlight">ports</span> (like mailbox
        numbers) to tag each piece. The transport layer sends them over the
        network. <strong>Demultiplexing</strong> happens at the other end, where
        the receiving device unpacks the stream and delivers each piece to the
        right app, using ports to sort them. For example, port 80 for web, 443
        for secure web—TCP uses these to keep everything tidy!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Multiplexing packs, demultiplexing sorts—apps get their mail!

    <!-- Congestion Control in Transport Layer -->
    <section id="congestion-control">
      <h2>Congestion Control: Avoiding Traffic Jams 🚦</h2>
      <p>
        The internet’s like a busy highway, and too much data can cause a jam!
        The transport layer, especially TCP, uses
        <strong>congestion control</strong> to keep traffic flowing smoothly,
        like a traffic cop directing cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you stream a movie or send files, TCP watches the network for signs
        of crowding—like slow responses or lost packets. If it’s getting
        clogged, TCP slows down how fast it sends data, giving the network a
        breather. If things are clear, it speeds up. This balancing act ensures
        your Netflix doesn’t buffer forever and your emails don’t get stuck,
        keeping the internet happy for everyone!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Congestion control’s the cop keeping the internet’s roads clear!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Congestion Control Algorithms in TCP -->
    <section id="congestion-algorithms">
      <h2>TCP Congestion Control Algorithms: The Smart Drivers 🧠</h2>
      <p>
        TCP’s congestion control isn’t just random—it uses clever plans called
        <strong>algorithms</strong> to decide how fast to send data. Think of
        them as smart drivers who know when to brake or zoom!
      </p>
      <p>
        One big algorithm is <strong>TCP Reno</strong>, which starts slow
        (called slow start) to test the road, then speeds up if it’s clear. If a
        packet gets lost (a sign of traffic), it cuts speed in half and tries
        again carefully. Another is <strong>TCP Cubic</strong>, used in modern
        systems, which is bolder, speeding up faster but still slowing down if
        there’s trouble. For example, when you download a game, Cubic might help
        TCP zip through a clear network but ease up if servers are busy. These
        algorithms make TCP a pro at dodging internet jams!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        TCP’s algorithms drive smart to avoid network crashes!

    <!-- What is Checksum? -->
    <section id="checksum">
      <h2>Checksum: The Package Checker 📋</h2>
      <p>
        Ever worry your data might get scrambled on its way? The transport layer
        uses a <strong>checksum</strong> to check if your data arrives in one
        piece, like a quality inspector for packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        When TCP sends data, it calculates a number (the checksum) based on the
        data’s bits and sticks it in the
        <span class="highlight">packet header</span>. The receiving end
        recalculates the checksum and compares it. If they match, the data’s
        perfect! If not, TCP knows something got messed up (like a torn package)
        and asks for a resend. For example, when you send an email, the checksum
        ensures every word arrives as you wrote it. It’s TCP’s way of keeping
        things flawless!
      </p>
      <p class="example">Checksum’s the inspector ensuring your data’s A-OK!</p>

    <!-- What are Timers? -->
    <section id="timers">
      <h2>Timers: The Delivery Clock ⏰</h2>
      <p>
        TCP uses <strong>timers</strong> to keep deliveries on schedule, like a
        clock watching how long packages take to arrive. If something’s late or
        lost, timers tell TCP to take action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main timer is the <strong>retransmission timer</strong>. When TCP
        sends a packet, it starts a countdown. If no “got it” signal
        (acknowledgment) comes back before the timer runs out, TCP assumes the
        packet’s lost and resends it. Another is the
        <strong>keep-alive timer</strong>, which checks if a connection’s still
        active during quiet moments, like pinging a friend to see if they’re
        there. For example, when streaming a video, timers ensure missing chunks
        get resent fast so you don’t miss the action!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Timers keep TCP’s deliveries ticking like clockwork!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sequence Numbers in Timers -->
    <section id="sequence-numbers">
      <h2>Sequence Numbers in Timers: The Package Labels 🏷️</h2>
      <p>
        To make timers work, TCP uses <strong>sequence numbers</strong>, like
        labels on packages to track their order. They’re super important for
        keeping data organized and spotting what’s missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every packet TCP sends gets a unique sequence number, like “Packet #1,
        #2, #3.” The receiver uses these to put data in the right order and send
        back acknowledgments, like “Got #1!” If a timer runs out (say, for #2),
        TCP sees the missing acknowledgment and resends that packet. For
        example, when you download a song, sequence numbers ensure the music
        arrives in order, and timers catch any dropped notes. It’s like a
        tracking system for perfect deliveries!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Sequence numbers label packets so timers save the day!
