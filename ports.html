    <section id="port-basics">
      <h2>Port Numbers: What Are They? 🚀</h2>
      <p>
        Think of your computer as a busy hotel. The
        <strong>IP address</strong> is the hotel’s address—like “123 Internet
        Street”—so the internet knows where to send stuff. But inside the hotel,
        there are tons of rooms (like your apps: games, chats, browsers).
        <strong>Port numbers</strong> are like room numbers—they tell the
        internet which room to deliver messages to. Without them, your computer
        would be confused, like a mailman with no directions!

      <h2>IP and Port Number: Chatting with a Friend 📞</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you and your friend want to chat online. Your computer has an IP
        address, say <strong>192.168.1.5</strong>, and your friend’s is
        <strong>192.168.1.10</strong>. But you’re both doing other stuff
        too—like browsing or gaming. How does your chat message find the right
        app?
      </p>
      <p>
        Port numbers save the day! Your chat app might use port
        <strong>5000</strong>, and your friend’s uses <strong>5001</strong>.
        When you send a message, it’s like mailing a letter to “192.168.1.10,
        Room 5001.” The message skips the games and goes straight to the chat
        app—perfect!

    <!-- How Many Bits Port Number -->
    <section id="bits">
      <h2>Bits and Port Numbers: Tiny Switches 🔧</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>bit</strong> is a super small switch—either on (1) or off (0).
        Port numbers use <strong>16 bits</strong>, which means they’re made of
        16 little switches. With 16 bits, you can make numbers from 0 to 65,535.
        It’s like having 65,536 room numbers in our hotel—each one is unique for
        a different app!
      </p>

    <!-- How Many Port Numbers Are There -->
    <section id="total-ports">
      <h2>How Many Port Numbers Exist? 🧮</h2>
      <p>
        Because port numbers use 16 bits, there are <strong>65,536</strong> of
        them—counting from 0 to 65,535. That’s a huge number of rooms! Your
        computer only uses a few at a time, like when you’re chatting or
        browsing, so there’s plenty to go around.

      <h2>Famous Port Numbers: The Cool Kids 🎸</h2>
      <p>
        Some port numbers are super famous because big services use them. Check
        these out:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Port 80</strong>: The web’s front door (HTTP). Your browser
          uses it to visit websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Port 443</strong>: The safe web door (HTTPS). It’s for secure
          sites, like online shopping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Port 22</strong>: The remote control door (SSH). It lets
          people log into computers from far away.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These ports are like celebrity room numbers—everyone knows where to find
        them!

    <!-- Reserved Ports -->
    <section id="reserved-ports">
      <h2>Reserved Ports: VIP Rooms ✨</h2>
      <p>
        The first <strong>1,024</strong> ports (0 to 1023) are special—they’re
        <strong>reserved ports</strong>. Only important services, like HTTP (80)
        or HTTPS (443), can use them. They’re like VIP rooms in the hotel,
        locked for big guests only. Random apps can’t just barge in!
      </p>

    <!-- Registered Ports -->
    <section id="registered-ports">
      <h2>Registered Ports: Clubhouse Rooms 🎉</h2>
      <p>
        Ports from <strong>1,024 to 49,151</strong> are called
        <strong>registered ports</strong>. That’s a big chunk—48,128 ports! Apps
        can sign up to use these, like a chat app picking port 5000. It’s like a
        clubhouse where apps get their own room numbers so others know where to
        find them.
