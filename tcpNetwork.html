      <h2>TCP/IP Network Layer: The Internet’s Map Maker 🗺️</h2>
      <p>
        How does your message find its way from your phone to a server across
        the world? Say hi to the <strong>TCP/IP network layer</strong>, the
        internet’s map maker! It’s like a super-smart guide who picks the best
        paths for your data to travel. We’ll see how it works, check out its
        routing and forwarding lists, explore its step-by-step delivery, and
        learn about its control tricks and path-finding styles. Ready to follow
        the map? Let’s adventure! 🚀

    <!-- How Network Layer Works -->
    <section id="how-network-layer-works">
      <h2>How the Network Layer Works: The Path Finder 📍</h2>
      <p>
        The network layer is like a guide who finds the best way to send your
        stuff, like messages or videos, across the internet. It’s part of TCP/IP
        and uses <span class="highlight">IP addresses</span> to do its job.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you send a message, the network layer wraps it in a tiny
        <span class="highlight">package</span> with an IP address, like a label
        saying where it’s going (like a YouTube server). It picks a path through
        the web’s roads, passing your package from one stop to the next until it
        gets there. For example, when you watch a YouTube video, the network
        layer makes sure every clip finds its way to your phone, no matter how
        far!
      </p>
      <p class="example">

    <!-- Routing Table -->
    <section id="routing-table">
      <h2>Routing Table: The Big Map Book 📘</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>routing table</strong> is like a big map book that a network
        box (called a router) uses to decide where to send your packages. It’s
        full of directions for different places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each line in the routing table says, “If a package is going to this
        <span class="highlight">address</span>, send it this way.” For example,
        if your package is headed to “netflix.com,” the table might say, “Send
        it to Router B next.” Routers check this table to pick the best path,
        like a guide choosing the fastest road. When you stream a show, the
        routing table helps your video clips zip through the right stops!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Routing tables are map books for finding the best web paths!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Forwarding Table -->
    <section id="forwarding-table">
      <h2>Forwarding Table: The Quick Cheat Sheet 📝</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>forwarding table</strong> is like a quick cheat sheet that a
        router uses to toss packages to the next stop super fast. It’s a simpler
        version of the routing table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forwarding table lists just the key info: “This address goes to this
        next stop.” It’s built from the routing table but made to be speedy, so
        the router doesn’t waste time. For example, when you’re gaming online,
        the forwarding table helps your moves zoom to the game server without
        delay. It’s like a shortcut list for quick deliveries!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Forwarding tables are cheat sheets for super-fast package tossing!

    <!-- Hop-by-Hop Method -->
    <section id="hop-by-hop">
      <h2>Hop-by-Hop Method: The Relay Race 🏃</h2>
      <p>
        The network layer sends packages using the
        <strong>hop-by-hop method</strong>, like a relay race where each runner
        passes the baton to the next. Every stop is a “hop.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When you send a message, it doesn’t zoom straight to the end. Instead,
        each router looks at the package’s address, checks its routing table,
        and hands it to the next router. This keeps going, hop by hop, until the
        package reaches its home. For example, when you email a friend, your
        message hops through lots of routers, like runners passing it along, to
        get to their inbox!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Hop-by-hop’s the relay race getting your stuff to the finish line!

    <!-- Difference Between Routing Table and Forwarding Table -->
    <section id="routing-vs-forwarding">
      <h2>Routing vs. Forwarding Tables: Map Book vs. Shortcut 🗺️📋</h2>
      <p>
        Routing and forwarding tables both help routers, but they’re like a big
        map book versus a quick shortcut list. Here’s how they’re different!
      </p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Routing Table</strong>: The big map book with all the details.
        It lists lots of paths, like “To this address, try this road or that
        one.” It’s used to plan the best route and can be updated slowly. -
        <strong>Forwarding Table</strong>: The shortcut list with just the next
        stop. It’s simpler, like “This address goes here next,” so routers can
        send packages crazy fast. It’s made from the routing table but built for
        speed. For example, when you watch Netflix, the routing table plans the
        path, but the forwarding table makes each hop super quick, so your show
        doesn’t lag!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Routing tables plan, forwarding tables speed things up!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Control Plane -->
    <section id="control-plane">
      <h2>Control Plane: The Brainy Planner 🧠</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>control plane</strong> is like the brainy planner behind the
        network layer, figuring out how to set up paths for your packages. It’s
        the boss of the routing table!
      </p>
      <p>
        The control plane decides which paths are best by talking to other
        routers and updating the routing table. It’s like a guide chatting with
        friends to find the quickest roads. For example, when you visit
        “google.com,” the control plane makes sure the routing table knows the
        best way to Google’s server, so your search loads fast. It’s the smart
        part that keeps the network organized!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Control plane’s the brain keeping paths ready for your stuff!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Static Routing vs. Dynamic Routing -->
    <section id="static-dynamic-routing">
      <h2>Static vs. Dynamic Routing: Set Paths vs. Smart Paths 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        The control plane can use two ways to pick paths:
        <strong>static routing</strong> and <strong>dynamic routing</strong>.
        They’re like using a fixed map versus a smart GPS!
      </p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Static Routing</strong>: This is like a fixed map you never
        change. Someone sets the paths in the routing table by hand, and they
        stay the same. It’s simple and good for small networks, like a home
        Wi-Fi, but if a road’s blocked, it won’t know! -
        <strong>Dynamic Routing</strong>: This is like a smart GPS that updates
        itself. Routers talk to each other, share road news, and change the
        routing table if a path’s busy or down. It’s great for big networks,
        like the internet, so your YouTube video finds the fastest way even if a
        router’s offline! For example, static routing might work for your home
        printer, but dynamic routing helps your Google searches zip through the
        web’s busy roads!
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Static’s a fixed map, dynamic’s a GPS for web adventures!
